<div class = "about">
  <div class = "title"><p>Have you ever been stuck on that silly calculus question asking you to take the partial derivative of some ridiculous equation? Or maybe you just can’t quite grasp the concept of why the mitochondria is “the powerhouse of the cell.” You’re looking for help from friends, but they’re all busy doing their own work or hitting the town with their hot dates. With your homework due later this evening, you don’t have time to schedule an appointment with your tutor or go to “academic development”, which is conveniently scheduled an hour after your homework is due. Tutyr comes to the rescue.<br>
  Now with Tutyr, you can quickly and easily find a tutor instantly rather than having to schedule an appointment. All you have to do is select your subject and Tutyr will connect you with an experienced college student in that subject and give you directions to their location on campus. Along with giving you instant access to tutors, our application will also be cheaper since the tutors get all the money, rather than a corporation or middleman taking a cut. Tutyr will not only benefit students in need of tutoring, but will also allow tutors a better opportunity. Tutors can work on-demand, or when they please, rather than having to predetermine schedules while also giving them a chance to do their own work in between sessions.<br>
  Tutyr will give students the chance to benefit from instant access to tutors while also giving them the opportunity to get paid for tutoring students in a field they have experience in.
